					<h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
					<p>
						Every person is a shopper, and every shopper loves a good deal. We
						at Couponder.com know that these deals can be a slight convenience
						at worse or a life-saving necessity at best. Our coupons are
						specially curated to show the biggest deals at the most relevant and
						available retailers. Our coupons stay up-to-date so you can be sure
						that whatever you save today can be used when you next go to the
						store. We hope someone can make use of each and every coupon
						available here and that those savings add up to a more fulfilling
						lifestyle!

					<h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
					<p>
						We prioritize user privacy to the utmost degree. Only the bare
						minimum information is collected to balance a user-friendly
						experience with a negligible risk of breachable data. Your first
						name is collected to greet you and identify your personal accounts.
						Your phone number is your login method as well as your point of
						contact, allowing you to share and update coupons across multiple
						devices simultaneously.
