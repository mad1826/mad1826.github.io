		<h1>Protein</h1>
		<p>
			A protein is a large molecule made up of amino acids (
			<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/protein">
				source: Brittanica
			</a>
			). They may be composed of about 20 different amino acids, and each animal
			species and their organs may process different types of proteins. This
			variety means that the purpose of one protein may be different from
			another's. However, most proteins still share similar qualities. The
			Australian government site
			<a

			>
				Better Health Channel
			</a>
			found the following general purposes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Helps form and support muscles and bones</li>
			<li>Produces necessary enzymes and hormones</li>
			<li>Provides the body with an energy source</li>
		</ul>

			Proteins are a common property in foods. They are not tied to any specific
			food group. Rather, modern nutritional guides such as
			<a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/food-group-gallery"
				>MyPlate</a
			>
			may categorize protein as a group on its own. Nevertheless, the most
			common sources of protein are found in meats and dairy products.
			<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/high-protein-foods"
				>Healthline</a
			>
			found the following amounts of protein are in one serving of each
			respective food:
